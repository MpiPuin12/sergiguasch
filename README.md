### Methods applied


### Results and analysis

After join in the dashboard the map and each plot/pie chart we've been going through during all the different analysis , we have obtained the next image:

![Getafix_Dashboard](https://github.com/SergiGuasch/sergiguasch/blob/main/projects/getafix/Getafix_Dashboard.jpg)

As we can see from the dashboard above, we have a map in the center where appears the most representative states showing the number of job positions and the name/code frome the state. Also we have set a color scale from the most number of jobs as darker blue, while the states with less jobs positions related to data science are painted in a lighter blue.

On the other hand we can see a couple of pie charts that represents, by one hand the percentatge of top job positions and in the other hand the percentatge of the different kinds of degrees are required to get a job related in data science. 

So the left pie, shows mainly that Data Science position is eminently the most required positions to develop the job related, but also, we can see, that Machine learning (considered not just a tool) it is the second main job required. On the third position we can find the Data Analyst, and in the last positions appears the Business Intelligence, and other kinds.

In the right pie it shows how a Master degree is the most demanded degree to get a job related in Data Science, being more than a half of the total degrees. Following by close, the Bachelor it is the second most demanded degree, while PhD and others togetherrepresents less than the 10% of the total degrees.

Keep going with the plots, on the left down side of the dashboard appears the most demanded talents. Here we can see that mainly are experience and analytical talent as the most 
demanded, with around 70% of total. On the other hand, we can see how solutions, knowledge, management and responsabilities, are the remaining 30% and they are more or less equally distributed with the same percentage.
